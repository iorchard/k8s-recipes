ceph-builder
=============

This is ceph-builder recipes.

Ceph does not support debian very well so I created my own ceph builder for
debian 9 (stretch).

Thees are the recipes.

* k8s: ceph debian package builder using kubernetes
* docker: ceph debian package builder using docker
* robot: ceph debian package builder using docker and robotframework including
  push the packages to the local mirror.
